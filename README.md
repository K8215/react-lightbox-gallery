React Lightbox Gallery is a simple and customizable image gallery built using ReactJS. This gallery allows users to display images in a grid and can be easily customized.

## Getting Started

To use React Lightbox Gallery, you must have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Then, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and start the development server. You can then view the gallery by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## Customization

You can modify the styles in `src/assets/scss/` to change the appearance of the gallery and the lightbox.
